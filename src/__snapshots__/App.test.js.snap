          They do not provide treatment to clean and purify the water or anything else that enters storm sewer systems. The City of Charlottesville, the County of Albemarle, and the University of Virginia manage the storm drain systems throughout our community.

          As part of their Illicit Discharge Detection and Elimination (IDDE) programs, the members of RSEP have set up a hot line number for citizens to call (434-202-4179) if they suspect they have witnessed illicit dumping into or near a storm drain, or other potential water pollution incidents. If you are not sure whether an illicit discharge has occurred, we suggest you report it anyway, and we can determine whether some action is required to protect the water supply and/or the environment.

          </li>
          <li>
            Gasoline, motor oil, brake fluid, engine coolant (antifreeze) and other toxic automotive products.
